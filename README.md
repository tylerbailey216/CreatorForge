## CreatorForge

Landing page for the CreatorForge content creator toolkit. Built as a single static `index.html` you can open directly in a browser or serve locally.

### Run locally
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve from the repo root with `python -m http.server 8080` and visit `http://localhost:8080`.

### Deployment
- Changes pushed to `main` are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via the included workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
